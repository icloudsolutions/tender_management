    <!-- All Etimad settings have been moved to a standalone configuration form
         accessible via: Etimad Tenders → Configuration → Settings
         This avoids the 'Invalid fields: Document, Spreadsheet, Folder' error
         caused by the Documents Enterprise module on the main Settings page.
         
         The res.config.settings model still has fields defined for backward 
         compatibility but they are no longer shown in the Settings UI. -->
